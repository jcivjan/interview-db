If this word and concept intimidate you, know you are in good company; most people cringe at the idea. There are, however, some easy ways to make connections with new people and strengthen connections you already have.</p> \r\n\r\n<h3>Your current communities</h3>\r\n<p>The good news is that you already have a network in your friends and family. Add to that people that you know from different social organizations, such as RSOs, sports teams, or spiritual organizations. These connections are part of your network even though you don't know them in a professional setting. They may work at a job related to one you are seeking, and they might be able to share information and contacts that could help you in your job search. Don't be afraid to say to your connections, \"I'm really interested in [name of field/job]. Is there someone you know who could help me learn more?\"</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Making new contacts</h3>\r\n<p>You might be introduced to someone at an event, or you might have the opportunity to set up an informational interview with a new contact. A good way to break the ice is to ask the other person  purposeful questions. People generally like talking about themselves, including what they do for work and their interests. Place your focus on getting to know your new contact and thinking about how this person might fit in to your network. You're not asking for a job, just more information. Try: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>What steps did you take that led to your current job? </li>\r\n<li>What is the most satisfying aspect of your job? </li>\r\n<li>What are the biggest challenges you face? </li>\r\n<li>What would you differently if you had to do it all over again? </li>\r\n<li>What one piece of advice do you have for someone starting out? </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Stay positive</h3>\r\n<p>The way you present yourself makes a lasting impression. While it is normal to feel nervous or discouraged when talking to someone who might have a job connection, the key is to remain positive and optimistic when introducing yourself. Keep in mind that networking goes two ways \u2013 each person must benefit.

Competition may exist, but you don\u2019t have to suffer because of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some options for dealing with competition:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Acknowledge your frustrations and disappointments</strong> \u2013 When you are feeling the burden of competition, give your feelings a voice.

Dealing with competition means developing a healthy attitude toward both winning and losing. Be proud when you\u2019re successful, and don\u2019t beat yourself up if you don\u2019t always excel. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Focus on yourself and your own goals</strong> \u2013 The \u201ceveryone else is better than me\u201d mindset disappears when you don\u2019t focus on everyone else. Focus on the goals YOU set for yourself. Be clear about what you want to achieve and work steadily toward it. Acknowledge how much you\u2019re learning, and be proud of the effort you put in AND how you\u2019re taking care of yourself. Other people\u2019s performance doesn\u2019t matter. Really.</li>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Cultivate a non-competitive environment</strong> \u2013 If you wish the environment in your program were less competitive, then make a change to be kinder. Offer help to others\u2013they may be willing to reciprocate in the future. When someone announces an achievement, offer a sincere congratulations, and then change the subject. Let your work and your actions speak for themselves.</li>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Recognize that admission into a competitive program is not admission into an elite program</strong> \u2013 UW has several capacity-constrained majors, and it\u2019s true that not everyone who applies to one of these majors can be accepted. Recognize that those accepted are not better people than those who were not accepted. Don\u2019t tie your self-worth to an institutional constraint.</li>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>See happiness as a greater accomplishment</strong> \u2013 Finally, recognize that your happiness and overall mental health are more important than grades and school. Invest in friendships. Take time to play and relax. Super competitive students are usually not happy.

How do you find friends you really click with?", "long_body": "<p>One thing we've heard from students is that it's a lot easier to make friends with people who share your interests once you're in a major. Until then, however, it can be challenging, especially if you\u2019re taking large lecture courses where it may be difficult to get to know your classmates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some people get lucky and instantly bond with roommates, or teammates, or find the community they're looking for in an RSO. If you're still feeling like you haven't met your peeps, however, don\u2019t give up. Finding true friends takes time, patience, and a little effort. Following are some strategies that might pay off.\r\n\r\n<h3>Opportunities for Conversation</h3>\r\n<p>First, look for opportunities to have increasingly more substantive conversations with others over time. Over the course of a quarter, classes, and maybe study groups are two places you're likely to see the same people repeatedly. Try to learn more about the people around you each time you meet. Strategies include: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Study groups</strong> \u2013 Try taking 5 minutes at the start of your group for all members to \u201ccheck in\u201d and share in a sentence or two how they are and what\u2019s going on for them. You\u2019ll get to know each other better this way, and can always follow up after the study session is over.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Classes</strong> \u2013 In small classes, it's a lot easier to see the same people repeatedly. Take advantage of time before and after class, or when assigned to a group, to introduce yourself and, over time, move from talking about things related to the class to things beyond the class. Students often say that the quarter ends just as they\u2019re starting to know their classmates. If you\u2019re not sure you\u2019ll see these classmates again but would like to continue getting to know them, tell them. It can be as simple as, \u201cIt was fun working with you this quarter. Would you like to keep in touch?\u201d</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Express Your Values</h3>\r\n<p>Second, express your values. Often the people we \u201cclick\u201d with are people who share our values or interests, or who have similar personality traits or life experiences. The values or experiences that count, however, may not be visible from the outside. Look for ways that people elect to show what they care about\u2013joining RSOs, volunteering, participating in certain events\u2013and do the same. Get to know some people in these environments, and ask them to introduce you to other people they know. The more broad your interactions, the more likely you\u2019ll eventually find the folks that make you feel at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Be Open To It</h3>\r\n<p>Finally, be open. You never know when a shared experience (missed bus?) will lead you to discover that you and a stranger have something deeply meaningful in common.</p>", "image": "interview_db_images/tired_feeling_alone.jpg", "image_credit": "Dennis Wise", "image_alt_text": "A crowd of students walking to classes on Red Square.", "category": 3, "slug": "tired-feeling-alone", "phase": "A", "quarter": "winter", "week": 4, "related_articles": [3, 4, 19], "related_links": [4, 5]}}, {"model": "interview_db.article", "pk": 8, "fields": {"title": "Falling in Love with a Class", "short_body": "What are you taking this quarter?

Especially if you\u2019re crazy busy or feeling stressed, the last thing you probably want to hear is someone reminding you to take care of your health. But you probably know this already: when you prioritize your health, tasks that seem overwhelming suddenly become manageable. And over time, you\u2019re likely to be happier and better able to handle your work and other challenges if you attend to your wellness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How to do that with limited time? Make time for activities that will restore and nourish your body and brain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some options we found that are great rejuvenators:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Breathe deeply</strong> \u2013 First thing in the morning, in the shower, on the bus, any time you think of it. Take 5-10 deep breaths that fill your belly and lungs, and exhale slowly. That extra boost of oxygen will clear your mind and help reduce stress.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Meditate</strong> \u2013 This is more intentional deep breathing, where you find a place to sit, close your eyes, and focus carefully on your inhale and exhale. Acknowledge when thoughts appear, then go back to the breath without any judgment. 15-20 minutes is ideal.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Engage your senses</strong> \u2013 Prepare a good meal if you can, or at least eat one, slowing down to savor the tastes and textures. Close your eyes and listen fully to your favorite music. Take a walk outside in nature, taking in the smells and temperature of the air. Draw or color. If you're so lucky, play or snuggle with a furry pet.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Move</strong> \u2013 Do anything to get your blood pumping for at least a minute, multiple times a day. 25 jumping jacks. Wild dancing to your favorite tunes. Skipping across the quad \u2013 getting outside provides an extra boost. This kind of movement can interrupt the stress response. And it will probably make you want to move more often, for longer.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Feel gratitude</strong> \u2013 When you spend time thinking about someone or something you appreciate, you release positive brain chemicals. New brain science says that you\u2019re a tiny bit healthier whenever you conjure a positive emotional thought. Make it a goal every day to conjure more positive thoughts than negative. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Say no</strong> \u2013 To whatever you know will cause you to overextend yourself. Or whatever doesn\u2019t feel right for you.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Say yes</strong> \u2013 To goofing around and laughing hard. To spending time talking with others \u2013 in person or on the phone. Really restorative activity gets you away from the screen.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Sleep</strong> \u2013 Yeah, we know you\u2019ve heard this one before, but here it is again because it\u2019s so important. Your body needs sleep to function at its best, physically, mentally, emotionally. Can\u2019t get 8 hours of sleep? Nap. Research says 25 minutes is good, 60-90 minutes is better.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Take care of your health, and other things will look a lot more manageable.</p>", "image": "interview_db_images/no_time_to_be_healthy.jpg", "image_credit": "Tricia Caparas", "image_alt_text": "UW Students make time to enjoy the UW/UCLA football game in 2010.", "category": 3, "slug": "no-time-be-healthy", "phase": "A", "quarter": "winter", "week": 6, "related_articles": [6, 7, 14], "related_links": [7]}}, {"model": "interview_db.article", "pk": 10, "fields": {"title": "Solve World Problems", "short_body": "You care deeply about something \u2013 climate change, human rights, clean energy, healthcare \u2013 and want to help solve world problems.

Do you like being \"up close and personal\" with a problem&#8211;on the ground administering vaccines, for example&#8211;or do you prefer to address \"the big picture\" &#8211;maybe monitoring the path of an epidemic? The next step is to identify which disciplines (and majors) best align to the way in which you like tackling and solving problems. One way to do this is by searching UW.edu or UW Today for news about faculty or organizations working on the issues you care about. Find the people mentioned, and make an appointment to talk to them. Try to get a sense of the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>How are they approaching the problem?</li>\r\n<li>What types of questions are they asking?</li> \r\n<li>What tools and methods are they bringing to bear on the problem?</li> \r\n<li>What knowledge and skills do they anticipate will be needed to effectively address this problem in the future?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Another approach is to <a href=\"https://myplan.uw.edu\" target=\"_blank\">search for courses</a> with key words related to the issue you care about. Talk to a librarian to learn more about the perspectives different disciplines bring to bear on this issue. Know of a major that might be of interest? Find someone in that major and talk to them about it to learn what approaches to problems are used in that discipline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, recognize that you may get to create your own career path through a combination of courses and majors; it's rare to find a major that exactly matches a career.

They may have been praised for their abilities when they were younger and may feel like they don\u2019t need to put in a lot of effort because their achievements have always \u201cjust come naturally.\u201d When people with a fixed mindset encounter a genuine challenge, they begin to doubt their abilities and avoid taking risks in the future, for fear of looking like a failure or having their deficiencies exposed. They\u2019re also not very good at hearing critical feedback, because what they hear is that someone is disappointed in them, not that there are ways that they can improve their work, or their relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A Growth Mindset</h3>\r\n<p>In contrast, people with a \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d believe that qualities like intelligence, creativity, and even the capacity for positive relationships, can be developed through effort and practice. They are not defined by their failures, but see them as an opportunity to try harder next time. When they encounter a challenge, they\u2019re motivated to find a solution and may encourage themselves with the thought, \u201cI don\u2019t have the answer&#8230;yet.\u201d In addition, people with a growth mindset welcome critical feedback, because they know it will tell them where they need to place their effort in order to succeed, in their work or relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may have a \u201cfixed\u201d or \u201cgrowth\u201d mindset at different times in your life, or in different areas of your life.

Write down the name of your employer or supervisor, your job title, dates of employment (the month and year you started and ended), and location.</p>\r\n<p>Write one sentence that summarizes what you did \u2013 a short description of the whole experience.

From start to finish, or for what portion?</li> \r\n<li>Did you work alone or collaboratively? What was your role?</li> \r\n<li>Did you take on increasing duties and/or responsibilities over time?</li> \r\n<li>Did people receive better/faster service because of you?<li> \r\n<li>Did someone learn something from your instruction or participation?<li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Again, just write.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Repeat the steps above for each experience (employment, volunteering) you plan to include.</p> \r\n\r\n<h3>2. Translate</h3>\r\n<p>Rewrite your brainstorm notes to help employers understand specifically what you did.</p>\r\n<p>Look at your first experience. Imagine an employer saying, \"Tell me more.\" Experiment with ways to describe your experience more clearly and to be more specific and/or detailed. For example, if you initially wrote, \u201cConstructed decks and patio covers\u201d to describe your work, you might think about what other information an employer would want to know. Your new description might be, \"Involved in planning through completion with construction of custom decks and patio covers for residential clients.\u201d</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Again, repeat this step for each experience you plan to include. When you're done, have your buddy or someone else read over all your descriptions and identify the places where they want to know more details. Revise as necessary.</p> \r\n\r\n<h3>3.

Ask them to identify any errors and then correct these.</li> \r\n<li>Spell check again.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Think about where you are submitting your resume.Place the most relevant experience on top; it is critical for the reader to see a match between your experience and their job description in that 10 second skim.</p> \r\n\r\n<h3>Congratulate yourself</h3>\r\n<p>Constructing a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is not easy, but you did it.</p>", "image": "interview_db_images/does_resume_represent_you.jpg", "image_credit": "Doug Plummer", "image_alt_text": "Student working at a residence hall.", "category": 2, "slug": "does-your-resume-represent-you", "phase": "A", "quarter": "spring", "week": 1, "related_articles": [5, 11, 16, 19], "related_links": []}}, {"model": "interview_db.article", "pk": 19, "fields": {"title": "Plan Your Life by Accident", "short_body": "\"Accidents\" \u2013 unplanned events or serendipitous encounters \u2013 are often what people say led them to their major or career.
